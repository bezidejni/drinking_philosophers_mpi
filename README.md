# Drinking philosophers problem

This is an attempt to solve the [drinking philosophers problem](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~misra/scannedPdf.dir/DrinkingPhil.pdf) using Python and [MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface). It requires a MPI working MPI implementation installed, preferably [MPICH](http://www.mpich.org/).

This is still in beta and probably can be improved.
